# Project Text Sentiment Classification

The goal of this project is to classify the emotions of tweets (positive or negative). For this we are given a data set of 2.5 million tweets on which to train our model.

We have implemented 4 different methods (GloVe, word2vec, cnn, fastText). The method we retained for the final implementation was fastText. In each of the corresponding folders is a readme explaining how to run the code.

The data is stored in a folder called data. There are three subfolders: "original" containing the original data files, "processed" contained the tokenised data files, and "fasttext" containing data files formatted for fasttext.
